Written by: Andrew Dunne
Final change date: 05/05/24

This program lets the user do the four basic calculation types (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with two numbers. 
The calculator itself is hard coded.
The program will never exit/stop by itself, you need to manually force stop it.
